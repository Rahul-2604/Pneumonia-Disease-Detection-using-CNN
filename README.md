# Pneumonia-Disease-Detection-using-CNN
A deep learning project that detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Designed to assist in early diagnosis by classifying images as Pneumonia or Normal.

Technologies Used :
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
CNN
PIL
NumPy
Matplotlib
Jupyter notebook
ImageDataGenerator

Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)

Categories: Pneumonia, Normal

Features
Data preprocessing and augmentation

CNN model architecture for classification

Training and evaluation with accuracy/loss plots

Model performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall

How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-detection-cnn.git
Open and run the Jupyter/Colab notebook:
Pneumonia_Detection_CNN.ipynb

Results
Achieved accuracy: 58%

Model trained on augmented dataset and validated on unseen images.

Future Improvements
